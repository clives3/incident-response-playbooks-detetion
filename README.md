**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-04-15

**Purpose:** This playbook outlines the steps for identifying, responding to, containing, eradicating, recovering from, and learning from malware infection incidents.

**Scope:** This playbook applies to all suspected malware infections affecting company endpoints, servers, or network devices.

**Roles and Responsibilities:**

- **Security Analyst:** Initial triage, analysis, containment, and eradication.
- **Endpoint Security Administrator:** Assistance with endpoint isolation, scanning, and remediation.
- **Server Administrator:** Assistance with server isolation and remediation.
- **Network Engineer:** Assistance with network isolation and traffic analysis.
- **Incident Response Lead:** Coordination, communication, and escalation as needed.

**Phases of Incident Response:**

## 1. Preparation

- Ensure up-to-date antivirus/endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions are deployed and properly configured.
- Maintain offline backups of critical systems and data.
- Establish procedures for isolating infected systems from the network.
- Train security and IT staff on malware analysis and remediation techniques.

## 2. Identification

- User reports suspicious activity or receives an alert from the antivirus/EDR system.
- Security Analyst reviews the alert details, including the type of malware, affected system(s), and any associated indicators of compromise (IOCs).
- Analyze the behavior of the suspected malware (if possible in a sandbox environment).
- Check logs (system, application, security) for related events.

## 3. Containment

- **Isolate the infected endpoint:** Disconnect the affected computer from the network (both wired and wireless).
- **Isolate affected servers:** If a server is infected, isolate it based on the potential impact and lateral movement. This might involve network segmentation or shutting down non-essential services.
- **Prevent lateral movement:** Review network traffic logs and potentially block communication to known malicious command-and-control (C2) servers.
- **Consider isolating affected user accounts:** If user credentials might be compromised, consider temporarily disabling or restricting access.

## 4. Eradication

- **Run full system scans:** Utilize updated antivirus/EDR software to scan and remove the identified malware and any associated files or registry entries.
- **Manual removal:** In some cases, manual analysis and removal of persistent malware components might be necessary.
- **Patch vulnerabilities:** Identify and patch any underlying vulnerabilities that might have allowed the malware to infect the system.
- **Consider reimaging:** For severely infected endpoints, reimaging the operating system might be the most efficient and reliable way to ensure complete eradication.

## 5. Recovery

- **Restore from backups (if necessary):** If data has been encrypted or corrupted, restore affected files and systems from clean backups.
- **Verify system integrity:** Ensure all systems are functioning correctly and are free of malware.
- **Restore network connectivity:** Once systems are deemed clean, reconnect them to the network.
- **Monitor for recurrence:** Closely monitor the affected systems for any signs of reinfection.

## 6. Lessons Learned

- Conduct a post-incident review to analyze the malware, its entry point, the effectiveness of the response, and any gaps in security controls.
- Update antivirus/EDR rules and signatures.
- Improve employee training on malware awareness.
- Review and update patching policies and procedures.

**Scripts:**

- `scripts/analyze_process.ps1`: [Placeholder for a PowerShell script to analyze running processes for suspicious activity].
- `scripts/extract_iocs.py`: [Placeholder for a Python script to extract IOCs (e.g., file hashes, IP addresses) from malware analysis reports].

**Templates:**

- `templates/system_isolation_checklist.md`: [Checklist to ensure proper isolation of infected systems].
- `templates/remediation_report.md`: [Template for documenting the steps taken to remediate the malware infection].
